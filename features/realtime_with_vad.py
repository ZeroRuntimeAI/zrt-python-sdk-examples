# realtime.py with two things in front of the model: VAD and denoise.
# A realtime model hears the caller directly, so anything that shapes that
# audio has to sit in the pipeline -- SileroVAD marks where speech starts and
# stops, which is what sharpens time to first byte (TTFB), and AICousticsDenoise
# cleans the inbound stream before either of them sees it.
