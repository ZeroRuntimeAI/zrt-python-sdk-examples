# zeroruntime examples

Runnable examples for the [zeroruntime](https://zeroruntime.ai)
Python SDK.

Every file here is standalone. One file is one idea — a pipeline shape, a tool
pattern, a piece of call control — and each opens with a comment explaining
what it demonstrates and which detail is the point. Read the top of a file
before running it; that comment is the documentation.

## Layout

```
features/          the examples — pipeline shapes, speech, telephony, vision
tools/             function tools, MCP servers, humans in the loop      *
context/           what the agent remembers, and handing it to another  *
observability/     hooks, events, tracing, recording                    *
avatars/           giving the agent a face                              *
```

`*` — some examples in these folders need an account, an extra package or a
running service. Those folders carry their own README with the steps;
everything in `features/` runs on the setup below.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeroRuntimeAI/zrt-python-sdk-examples
cd zrt-python-sdk-examples
```

If you'd rather not pick a path below, `./setup.sh` takes either one for you:
it prefers `uv`, falls back to `venv` + `pip`, and seeds `.env` from
`.env.example`. It never overwrites an existing `.env`.

### With uv

```bash
uv sync
```

That creates `.venv` and installs everything. Run an example without
activating anything:

```bash
uv run features/basic_cascade.py
```

### With pip

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install zeroruntime httpx
```

Either way you get one environment that runs every example in this repo.

## Credentials

Every example calls `load_dotenv()`, which searches upward from the file, so
one `.env` at the repo root serves all of them:

```bash
ZERORUNTIME_AUTH_TOKEN=...
```

Then add a key per vendor the example's pipeline names. The full set across
this repo, though no single example needs all of them:

```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...      # DeepgramSTT
CARTESIA_API_KEY=...      # CartesiaTTS
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...    # ElevenLabsTTS
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...        # GoogleLLM, GoogleTTS, GeminiRealtime
OPENAI_API_KEY=...        # OpenAILLM, OpenAITTS
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...     # AnthropicLLM
SARVAMAI_API_KEY=...      # SarvamAISTT, SarvamAITTS
SIMLI_API_KEY=...         # SimliAvatar
ANAM_API_KEY=...          # AnamAvatar
```

Providers imported from `zeroruntime.inference` reach the gateway instead of the vendor,
so they need `ZERORUNTIME_AUTH_TOKEN` and no vendor key at all — see
`features/inference_gateway.py`. `SileroVAD` runs locally and needs nothing.

## Running

```bash
uv run features/basic_cascade.py       # uv
python features/basic_cascade.py       # pip, with .venv activated
```

The agent serves, joins a room, and prints a playground URL once on stdout.
Open it and talk to the agent. Ctrl-C to stop.
